"Journey" - a Text-based Adventure Game by Michael Ton and Adam Mercado


This game was created for OSU's Capstone course in Fall 2020 using Python, with the requirements that no additional software or libraries be used, and that rooms in the game are generated using a method other than hard-coding the data.  Our approach was to use JSON encoding and decoding, which was also used for saving and loading the game state.


Setup:

The game is intended to run and be played on OSU's flip server.  Install the source code in a directory, and navigate to it. 

In that directory, run the following command: python3 main.py

Gameplay:

The game receives user input on the command-line. The player can move, look at objects around them, pick up and drop items, and use certain items to progress the game.  The user can enter the command "help" to open a menu with submenu options to display valid command inputs.

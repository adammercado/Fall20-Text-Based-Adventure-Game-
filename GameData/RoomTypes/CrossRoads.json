To the rear of the clearing, narrow roads lead off into multiple directions. At the entrance to the center there is a merchant and his stand filled with baubles. The Merchant is looking at Derek and gestures for him to come nearer. Behind all the stands, multiple roads lead off into different directions. Each road entrance has a sign next to it."

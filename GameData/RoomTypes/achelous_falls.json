Emerging from the trees, he comes face to face with not just a river, but the tail of a rapidly flowing stream leaping off of a nearby cliff to form a <waterfall>.  He stares in amazement at how the seemingly endless water rushes off the edge. As his eyes follow upstream, he witnesses several batches of large multi-colored fish hopping in and out of the water, like excited kids on a fast ride.\n\nTurning more upstream and to the east, the Boy notices an archway in front of numerous buildings - a <town entrance>. Near the area’s entrance, he can see humans moving about. “People!”, he exclaims.  Knowing a familiar species exists around here, let alone fellow humans, helps him feel a sense of normalcy and relax a bit. A sign near the flowing water reads: “Achelous Falls”.\n",
	"short_desc": "The <waterfall> is as bustling as it always is, rushing to the edge and flowing downwards into a basin.  To the south is the forest, where he awoke earlier.",

	"longDesc": "As Derek walks through the enchanted forest, he comes across a clearing set between the trees.   A dilapidated tent rests near a rocky moss covered outcropping. It appears that somebody had used this place as a base camp and left a tent behind. The tent is still standing but the rear right corner is leaning in where a tent spike has pulled out. The front tent flaps dance with the gentle breeze. The tent has seen better days. Near the tent, is a small entrance to a cave.",
